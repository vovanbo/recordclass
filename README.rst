===========

**recordclass** is `MIT Licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ python library.
It implements the type ``memoryslots`` and factory function ``recordclass`` 
in order to create record-like classes. 

* ``memoryslots`` is ``tuple``-like type, which supports assignment operations. 
* ``recordclass`` is a factory function that create a "mutable" analog of 
  ``collection.namedtuple``.

This library actually is a "proof of concept" for the problem of fast "mutable" 
alternative of ``namedtuple``.

Main repository for ``recordclass`` 
is on `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/intellimath/recordclass>`_.

Here is also a simple `example <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/intellimath/recordclass/raw/default/examples/what_is_recordclass.ipynb>`_.
